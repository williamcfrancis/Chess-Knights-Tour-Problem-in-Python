# Solution to Chess Knights Tour Problem in Python

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.

The chess knights tour problem was tackled by using three different algorithms:

1. Backtracking
2. Brute force (open loop and closed loop)
3. Warnsdorff
